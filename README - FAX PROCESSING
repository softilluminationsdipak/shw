Fax Processing Readme

The FaxFetchWorker is a background process that currently uses sidekiq. It runs every 15 minutes to fetch email and parse it into the fax queue.

To start the FaxFetchWorker

1. Make sure that the fax_source username/password/email are defined in settings for customers and contractors
2. Run: bundle exec sidekiq

Note: The fax system previously used the depreciated backgroundrb to fetch and parse faxes.
