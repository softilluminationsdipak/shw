When a covered system or appliance breaks down due to normal wear and tear, you&rsquo;re protected for repair or replacement. There&rsquo;s no need to get back in touch with the real estate agent or track down the previous owner.\n\
      \t</li>\n\
      \t<li>\n\
      \t\t<h4>My home systems and appliances are old. Does that matter to Select?</h4>\n\

      \t\tNo, Select home warranty coverage does not require a home inspection to purchase.\n\
      \t</li>\n\

      \t\t<h4>What is a trade service call fee?</h4>\n\
      \t\tA trade service call fee is the amount due when a contractor visits your home. Each type of breakdown falls into a &ldquo;trade&rdquo; category, for example: a leaky pipe qualifies as a plumbing breakdown, while a broken dishwasher is an appliance breakdown. \n\
      \t\t<br><br>\n\
      \t\tSince it may require more than one contractor or several unrelated trips to the house by the same contractor (once to fix the pipe, another to fix the dishwasher), there is a fee due for each &ldquo;trade&rdquo; a service call covers. It&rsquo;s perfectly alright to report more than one breakdown at a time. Additional fees may apply if the repairs fall into different categories.\n\
      \t</li>\n\
      \t<li>\n\
      \t\t<h4>Is a warranty plan from Select renewable?</h4>\n\
