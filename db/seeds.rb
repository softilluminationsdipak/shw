  {slug: "terms_of_service", html: "\n<p>1. Binding Agreement. This Terms of Service Agreement (\"Agreement\") is a legally binding document between the warranty holder (\"You\" or \"Your\") and Select Home Warranty (\"Select\").  This Agreement constitutes the entire and only agreement between You and Select.  This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties and understandings between You and Select.  This Agreement provides for home warranty services only and should not be confused with an insurance contract.  Your home warranty coverage remains with the home covered and cannot be transferred to a different home.  This Agreement covers household appliances and systems when they become inoperable due to normal wear and tear.  This Agreement sets forth all of the household appliances and systems covered under this Agreement and the specific items that are excluded from coverage.  In the event an appliance or system is not mentioned in this Agreement, it will not be covered under this Agreement.  Please read the entire Agreement before retaining the services of Select.</p>\n\n<p>2.  Obligations.   In consideration for your payment to Select, and subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, Select will arrange for a qualified service contractor and/or technician (\"Select Service Technician\") to repair or replace the systems and appliances covered under this Agreement, when they become inoperable due to normal wear and tear. </p>\n\n<p>3.  Covered Homes.  This Agreement only covers systems and appliances in single-family dwelling, individual condominium units, town houses and modular homes.  Only those systems and appliances properly and permanently installed and located within the living area of the home will be covered.  This Agreement will not cover systems or appliances within (i) commercial properties; (ii) residential properties used for business purposes, including, but not limited to, dwellings used for rest homes, day care centers, schools and/or professional offices; and (iii) common areas of condominiums, multi-family houses(unless otherwise stated above) and/or cooperatives.  This Agreement will not cover any system or appliance designated by the manufacturer as being used for commercial use.</p>\n\n<p>4.  Term.  The term of Your warranty coverage, as set forth in this Agreement, shall begin |||WAIT_PERIOD_TEXT_OVERRIDE!||| (|||WAIT_PERIOD_DAYS_OVERRIDE!|||) days following Select's receipt of all outstanding payments and premiums due to Select are received by Select (\"Effective Date\") please add an additional 5 days for credit/debit card payments.  In the event Select does not receive all outstanding payments and/or premiums outstanding and/or signed contract, for any reason, Your warranty coverage term will not begin.  Your warranty coverage will begin on the Effective Date and remain in effect for one (1) calendar year following the Effective Date (\"Termination Date\"). Coverage waiting period may be expedited with proof of prior coverage's expiration date provided there was no lapse in coverage.</p>\n\n<p>5.  Claims Procedure.</p>\n\n<p>5.1.  Before Making a Claim.  Prior to making a claim you should:</p>\n\n<p>(i)  \tImmediately contact the proper authority in the event the malfunctioning appliance or system has the potential to cause injury to You or anyone else present in or near your home; </p>\n\n<p>(ii)  \tShut down the malfunctioning appliance or system to prevent further damage; and</p>\n\n<p>(iii) \tDetermine if the malfunctioning appliance or system is covered under this Agreement.</p>\n\n<p>5.2.  If Covered.  If this Agreement covers the malfunctioning appliance or system, you MUST contact Select PRIOR to obtaining service on the malfunctioning appliance or system.  Your failure to contact Select prior to obtaining service may render your claim invalid.  Select will not reimburse You if You use your own service technician without first obtaining Select's prior authorization.</p>\n\n<p>5.2.1.  Select Service Call Fee.  Each time a Select Service Technician is scheduled and dispatched to Your home, You will be required to pay the Select Service Call Fee in the amount of |||SERVICE_FEE_TEXT_OVERRIDE!||| ($|||SERVICE_FEE_AMT_OVERRIDE!|||) Dollars.  You will be required to pay the Select Service Call Fee regardless of whether all or part of the claim is granted, excluded, limited or denied by Select.  You will be required to pay the Select Service Call Fee once the Select Service Technician begins traveling to your home, regardless of whether you are able to provide access to your home for the Select Service Technician or if you cancel the appointment while the Select Service Technician is traveling to your home, a separate service call fee will be charged for each issue.  Additional charges may apply to the Select Service Call Fee.  The Select Service Call Fee, which must be paid at the time and place of appointment, shall be paid by You to the Select Service Technician or directly to Select, at Select's option.  In the event You fail to pay the Select Service Call Fee, You will not be able to schedule any additional service calls and your home warranty coverage will be suspended until all outstanding fees are paid in full.  Suspension of your home warranty coverage will not alter or extend the Termination Date of your home warranty coverage.   </p>\n\n<p>5.3.  Contact Information.  A Select representative can be reached  by telephone at 855-267-3532 or by e-mail at info@selecthomewarranty.com.   </p>\n\n<p>5.4.  Non-Emergency Claims.  To make a claim for repair you must contact Select immediately following discovery of the malfunctioning and/or inoperability of the system or appliance.  The Select Service Technician will be instructed to provide repair or replacement of the appliance or system within two (2) days during normal business hours and four(4) days on weekends and holidays following submission of the claim.  If covered by this agreement, the system and/or appliance repaired or replaced will be paid for by Select within a reasonable time following submission of the claim.  Select will not be liable for any delay in the repair and/or replacement of the inoperable appliance or system.</p>\n\n<p>5.5.  Emergency Claims.   In the event of an emergency, in order for Select to make a determination if the system and/or appliance causing the emergency is covered under this Agreement, You must contact Select prior to having the repair or replacement work performed.  In the event the emergency pertains to gas, fire or has the potential to cause injury to You or anyone else present in or near your home, you should take all reasonable steps, including, but not limited to, vacating the premises and contacting the proper authority to ensure the safety of You and those present.  Once the determination is made by the proper authority that your home is safe to re-inhabit, You must contact Select immediately and advise them of this claim. </p>\n\n<p>6.

  {slug: "faq", html: "<h1><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h1>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>What is a Home Warranty?</strong></h4>\n\t\tA home warranty is a service contract, usually covering one year, which helps protect homeowners against the cost of unexpected covered repairs or replacement on their major systems and appliances that break down due to normal wear and tear.\n\t</li>\t\t\n\t\n\t\t<h4><strong>I&rsquo;m selling my home. Why would I want a home warranty?</strong></h4>\n\t\tA Select Home Warranty gives buyers additional confidence in a real estate transaction—they know that Select stands behind the covered systems or appliances in the house. If they break down, buyers are covered for repair or replacement. An added benefit to the seller is that buyers will be calling us with their problems &mdash; not you.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>I&rsquo;m in the market for a home. What&rsquo;s the benefit of buying a home covered by a Select Home Warranty?</strong></h4>\n\t\tA warranty from Select helps provide protection during and after a home purchase. When a covered system or appliance breaks down due to normal wear and tear, you&rsquo;re protected for repair or replacement. There&rsquo;s no need to get back in touch with the real estate agent or track down the previous owner.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>My home systems and appliances are old. Does that matter to Select?</strong></h4>\n\t\tNo, the age of a home or its systems and appliances does not matter to Select. We cover items that are in good working condition at the time you purchase the plan and properly maintained. Plus, Select covers all makes and models of appliances and systems.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>What if I have an emergency?</strong></h4>\n\t\tOur claims department is available by email at claims@selecthomewarranty.com 24 hours, a day 7 days a week.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>Does Select need to inspect my home systems and appliances before I enroll?</strong></h4>\n\t\tNo, Select home warranty coverage does not require a home inspection to purchase.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>Is there a limit to the number of repairs Select covers?</strong></h4>\n\t\tNo, Select Home Warranty allows an unlimited number of covered repairs.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>What is a trade service call fee?</strong></h4>\n\t\tA trade service call fee is the amount due when a contractor visits your home. Each type of breakdown falls into a &ldquo;trade&rdquo; category, for example: a leaky pipe qualifies as a plumbing breakdown, while a broken dishwasher is an appliance breakdown. \n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\tSince it may require more than one contractor or several unrelated trips to the house by the same contractor (once to fix the pipe, another to fix the dishwasher), there is a fee due for each &ldquo;trade&rdquo; a service call covers. It&rsquo;s perfectly alright to report more than one breakdown at a time. Additional fees may apply if the repairs fall into different categories.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>Is a warranty plan from Select renewable?</strong></h4>\n\t\tYes, warranty-holders may renew their Select plan (at the option of Select). Select Home Warranty will notify the homeowner in advance of the expiration date, and Select will offer a variety of convenient payment plans.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>I hold Homeowner&rsquo;s Insurance. Why do I need a home warranty?</strong></h4>\n\t\tYour homeowner&rsquo;s insurance is hazard insurance and covers items damaged in fires, by water, by wind or other covered events. A home warranty repairs or replaces items that break down on their own through normal wear and tear.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>When does coverage begin and when does it end?</strong></h4>\n\t\tCoverage for your home&rsquo;s major systems and appliances begins 30 days after you sign up with Select, and the coverage lasts for one year.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>Do you offer Discounts for multiple year coverage?</strong></h4>\n\t\tYes we do. Please call us at <strong>855-267-3532</strong> to speak to a representative about multiple year options.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>Does Select Home Warranty cover condos and multiple units?</strong></h4>\n\t\tYes. Please call <strong>855-267-3532</strong> for pricing.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>What is the process to sign up?</strong></h4>\n\t\tYou can simply sign up online or call us at <strong>855-267-3532.</strong> We accept all major credit cards as well as check by phone.\n\t</li>\t\n\t<li>\n\t\t\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>I am selling my home, can Select Home Warranty send me an invoice so the funds can be taken from escrow at closing?</strong></h4>\n\t\tYes. Select Home Warranty representatives are standing by to assist you.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>Do you cover rental properties?</strong></h4>\n\t\tWe cover rental properties, mobile homes, manufactured homes, single family and multiple units as well as condos.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<h4><strong>What is the process if I have a claim?</strong></h4>\n\t\tSimply email us at claims@selecthomewarranty.com 24 hours a day and we will dispatch a local service technician to handle your claim promptly.\n\t</li>\n<li><h4><strong>Does Select cover everything?</strong></h4>\n\t\tSelect does have caps on repairs for systems as well as appliances. Please see our terms and conditions for specific maximum payout information.\n\t</li>\n</ul> "},
